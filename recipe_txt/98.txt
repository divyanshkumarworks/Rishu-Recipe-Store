prep time: 35

Description: It is a tempting south Indian dish prepared by adding lemon juice while stir frying steamed rice in spices. The lemon rice preparation is very similar to that of Chinese fried rice except that spices used in this recipe are different and its lemony yellow color will make your taste buds tingle as soon as you see it. Since this recipe requires stir frying steamed rice, it’s recommended to cook steamed rice at least 2-3 hours in advance or even better, use leftover rice.
