prep time: 31

Description: Mango Mousse, this mango based eggless dessert is extremely easy to make at home within 20 minutes and requires only 3 ingredients – mango pulp, heavy whipping cream and sugar. It has a creamy yet little firm texture as this recipe doesn’t use gelatin or agar gar (vegetarian version) as the setting agent. This mousse recipe uses fresh mango pulp but you can also use the store bought canned mango pulp if it’s not the season of mango. You can make this few hours ago or a day earlier if you want to serve it as the party dessert. Follow the below given recipe with step by step photos and enjoy the chilled mango mousse in the afternoon.
