Ingredient: Ingredients: 3 medium or 2 large Apples (approx. 500 gm, 2½ – 3 cups chopped or grated), 5-6 Cashew nuts, chopped, 5-6 Almonds, chopped, 1/4 cup Sugar (or to taste), 2 tablespoons Ghee, 1/4 teaspoon Cardamom Powder or Cinnamon Powder

Directions:
step-1: Choose the sweet apples to make this halwa. Rinse the apples. Peel them.
step-2: Cut them into small pieces using a knife (or in a chopper/food processor) or grate them using a grater. Don’t cut/grate the apples in advance as they will turn brown.
step-3: Heat 2 tablespoons ghee in a heavy based kadai or a pan over medium flame. Add chopped almonds and cashewnuts.
step-4: Shallow fry them until they turn golden. Transfer them in a bowl.
step-5: Add chopped/grated apples to the same kadai/pan. Stir and cook for a few seconds.
step-6: Then cook it covered until soft, for approx. 5-6 minutes.
step-7: Stir in between occasionally to prevent sticking.
step-8: If you are using chopped apples them mash them gently with the backside of a spatula. Cook until almost water is evaporated.
step-9: Add 1/4 cup sugar (more or less, to taste). The amount of sugar depends on the sweetness of apples.
step-10: Mix well. As the sugar dissolves, the mixture will turn gooey. Cook until almost water is evaporated.
step-11: Add 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder and mix well.
step-12: Turn off the flame. Add dry fruits and mix well. Apple halwa is ready for serving.
