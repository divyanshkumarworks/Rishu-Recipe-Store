Description:  Sweet Lassi, a yogurt based creamy, sweetened and chilled beverage from Punjabi cuisine is a popular drink in North India. It is usually served after the meal or in the afternoon during the hot summer days as a cooling beverage. Nowadays, many varieties of lassi like strawberry lassi, rose lassi, mango lassi, plain lassi, etc. are available but the two main types are – SWEET and SALTY. In this recipe, we are making the sweet lassi – first, the curd is whisked until smooth and then sugar is added for sweetness and cardamom to get the nice flavor. Finally, water or milk is added to dilute it a little bit as per the preference.  Curd is the key ingredient in lassi and so the whole taste depends on it. Use the homemade curd made from full fat milk, and make sure that it doesn’t taste sour to make the perfect lassi.
