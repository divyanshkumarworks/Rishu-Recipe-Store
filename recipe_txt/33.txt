Description: This Dal Makhani Recipe is very easy to make, simple and using only one pot (pressure cooker) yet the end result is delicious. First, the dal is cooked for 6-7 whistles in pressure cooker and then remaining ingredients are added to the dal and again cooked for 5-7 whistles. Finally, the cream is mixed with the dal and that’s it. Creamy dal makhani is ready. You can make this dal in instant pot as well by following the same method.

Ingredient: Ingredients: Salt, to taste, 1/2 teaspoon Red Chilli Powder, 1/2 cup Whole Black Urad Dal (black lentils), soaked in water for 6-8 hours, 3 tablespoons Rajma (red kidney beans), soaked in water for 6-8 hours, 1/2 tablespoon Ginger-Garlic Paste, 1/2 cup Tomato Puree, 1/2 teaspoon Kasuri Mehti, optional, 2 tablespoons Butter (or more if you like), 1/4 cup Fresh Cream

Directions:
